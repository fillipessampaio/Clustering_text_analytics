## 1. Assess situation

<p> With access through the electronic address 'https://comunica.pje.jus.br/', the platform has become an official means of subpoena for lawyers, which must include, in addition to the text of the publication, the court, the judging body, the unique case number, the names of the parties and their lawyers [National Council of Justice 2016].
  
Although the text of the publication is accompanied by the data mentioned above, there is no discrimination as to the type of act published. In this context, it is important to explore the technologies that help the automated processing of textual documents to recognize what is being published and label the texts according to the needs of the legal operator. </p>

## 2. Project goals

<p> This project intends to build a predictive model, based on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing algorithms, capable of attributing to each publication
from the National Electronic Justice Gazette one of the following categories: (1) ordinary act; (2) dispatch/decision; (3) sentence; (4) public notice; and (5) others.. </p>

## 3. Solution 

<p> Construction of predictive models, with accuracy between 90% and 97%;</p>
<p> Better knowledge about the content of published judicial acts;</p>
<p> Improvement of management tools;</p>
<p> Saving many hours of human labor.</p>
